# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a daily planner for anyone's schedule. This challenge allows us to get familiar with jQuery and javascript. During this challenge I learned to use jQuery syntax such as the $ sign to define a selector or find an element followed up with a jQuery action to be performed on that element. 

## Installation

Download the Work-Day-Scheduler folder which contains the html, css, and javascript files to open the webpage.

## Usage

Someone may use this website https://bradford-lee.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/ if they would like to create a daily planner and schedule events for the times between 6AM and 11PM. When you open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. If you scroll down you are presented with timeblocks with each text box color coded to indicate whether the time is past, present, or future. Past time indicated as gray, present time indicated as red, and future time indicated as green. When you enter a description in the textbox and click the save button for that timeblock, the text is saved in the local storage and a message is displayed at the top indicating it has been saved. When you refresh the page, the saved events remain on the timeblock. Please see the below screenshot for reference.
